## Description
This is a simple workout tracker app built with a postgresql database, using node.js and express. The goal of the app is to create a simple, minimalist, tracker for logging workouts. If a user has a workout they already follow they can simply put in the exercises, sets and reps, requiring only the weights from the user for that given day. If there is a change in sets or reps then changing them will be a 1 - 2 click to modify the data. All the user will have to do is worry the workout and not about the tracking of it. 

## Future Goals
Future goals include:
* Convert App into one page
* Allow for easy creation of workouts with reps, sets, and weights on one page
* Implement search bar for easy exercise look up
* Implement repeating workouts, by days
  * Allow user to pick days for workouts
  * Implement Dates
