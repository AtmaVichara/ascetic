## Description
This is a simple workout tracker app built with a postgresql database, using node.js and express. The goal of the app is to create a simple, minimalist, tracker for logging workouts. If a user has a workout they already follow they can simply put in the exercises, sets and reps, and the days for each individual workout, requiring only the weights from the user for that given day. If there is a change in sets or reps then changing them will be a 1 - 2 click to modify the data. All the user will have to do is worry the workout and not about the tracking of it. 

## Future Goals
Allow for users to share their workouts, so that if others wish to use them, or modify them for themselves, then they can import it into their regime.
